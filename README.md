### 🐚 A Bit About Me

Hii! I’m a programmer and am obsessed with OOP. I enjoy doing game development and design, creating small fun indie games. *please note most repo's are old and not an accurate representation of my current abilities.*

- 💻 Currently developing using Godot in C#.
- 🤝 Love collaborating with others on projects (I really need to my art skills are non-existent).

### 🚀 What I'm Up To

- Current Project: Developing a tower defence game where the players create the towers
- Side Projects: Marble siege like game simulation
